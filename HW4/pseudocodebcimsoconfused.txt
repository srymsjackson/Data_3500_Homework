read the lines

make the file into a list called "prices" (prices = [])

Loop through all the prices, calculating a 5 day moving average each time. 
Each iteration of the loop should update the current_price (the newest line), and the 5 day moving average 
(the average of the previous 5 days).

Add an if statement which checks to see if the current price is below the 5 day moving average * .98.  
If it is, “buy” the stock, meaning keep track of the price you bought at.  Update a variable called “buy” with the buy price.

Add an elif statement along with the if statement which checks to see if the current price is above the 
5 day moving average * 1.02.  If it is, “sell” the stock, meaning calculate the profit of that trade: sell - buy. 
You want to buy low and sell high, so sell - buy is hopefully positive.

Add an else statement along with the if else if which does not buy or sell.
